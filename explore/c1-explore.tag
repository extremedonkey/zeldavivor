{"title":"**{coordinate} |** *You are in a corner of the Desert Colossus*","description":"> The colossus is a vast, secluded area situated at the rear of the Haunted Wasteland, far out of Hyrule's boundaries and even those of the Gerudo's Fortress, the nearest civilization to the region. The most prominent feature of the desert is a giant monument known as the Desert Colossus and the \"goddess of the sand\".\n\nYou find yourself in a secluded corner of the Desert Colossus. There's not really much here, you see a palm tree, a few rocks and also a lone Leever (**?{coordinate}-inspect-leever**). Other than that, it's just a lot of sand!","image":{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1205174228555403284/1210245904569991218/OoT3D-Desert-Colossus.png?ex=65e9dc54&is=65d76754&hm=f65a651391e2bc861c4874f06e3038ab68abd6ca994a0be919e9010fc9898e9e&"},"author":{"name":"Zeldavivor","icon_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1205174228555403284/1205756728323346522/icon256.png?ex=65d98775&is=65c71275&hm=13e2b2d26bcb8c5e589e2c00ec189ce6112c453a2fc49454d07ef935fa067ee9&"},"color":8311585}
